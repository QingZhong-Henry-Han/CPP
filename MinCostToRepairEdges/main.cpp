//Min Cost to Repair Edges (Minimum Spanning Tree II)
//There's an undirected connected graph with n nodes labeled 1..n.
//But some of the edges has been broken disconnecting the graph.
//Find the minimum cost to repair the edges so that all the nodes are once again accessible from each other.

//Input:
//n, an int representing the total number of nodes.
//edges, a list of integer pair representing the nodes connected by an edge.
//edgesToRepair, a list where each element is a triplet representing the pair of nodes between
//which an edge is currently broken and the cost of repearing that edge,
// respectively (e.g. [1, 2, 12] means to repear an edge between nodes 1 and 2, the cost would be 12).

//Example 1:
//Input:
//n = 5, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [1, 5]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 2, 12], [3, 4, 30], [1, 5, 8]]
//Output: 20
//Explanation:
//There are 3 connected components due to broken edges: [1], [2, 3] and [4, 5].
//We can connect these components into a single component by repearing the edges between nodes 1 and 2,
//and nodes 1 and 5 at a minimum cost 12 + 8 = 20.

//Example 2:
//Input:
//n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [3, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 6, 410], [2, 4, 800]]
//Output: 410

//Example 3:
//Input:
//n = 6, edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [5, 6], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 4]], edgesToRepair = [[1, 5, 110], [2, 4, 84], [3, 4, 79]]
//Output: 79

//What is Minimum Spanning Tree?
//Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph
//that is a tree and connects all the vertices together.
//A single graph can have many different spanning trees.
//A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree for a weighted,
//connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree.
//The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree.

//How many edges does a minimum spanning tree has?
//A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph.    
//
// C++ program for Kruskal's algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree 
// of a given connected, undirected and weighted graph
